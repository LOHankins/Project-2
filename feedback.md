## Technical Requirements

Great job getting a couple of models with CRUD that are mostly associated to each other. Your initial scope was super ambitious and overall you did a good job dialing that back and getting stuff to work before adding a large number of under utilized features.

## Creativity and Interface

The app is styled and has an interface of value to the end user: it is not just a nav bar and an index page. The idea of the app is also really creative. The user interface could have been a little more polished.

Evaluation: *Progressing/Performing*

## Code Quality

Code is well-formatted, well-named, and contains few style / quality issues. The code you have looks good overall. I noticed that all of your indentation is done with tabs instead of spaces. This isn't a problem in ruby especially when you are working alone but might cause issues when you collaborate with people that use spaces instead of tabs. A quick fix is to get one of the sublime plugins that converts tabs to spaces and to change your settings to use soft tabs so hitting the tab key adds spaces instead of tabs.

## Deployment and Functionality

I saw that you might of tried to deploy at some point - based on your commits, but I couldn't find a link to a deployed version of your app anywhere. I'd be happy to look at it if you can link me to it.

Evaluation: *Incomplete*

## Planning / Process / Submission

App is submitted, with basic evidence of planning. Documentation exists, but lacks common areas such as setup instructions, description of application functionality and link to deployed application.

Evaluation: *Progressing*

## General notes

I'd suggest commiting more frequently, commits enable you to have a place to revert to. [Commit early and often](https://sethrobertson.github.io/GitBestPractices/#commit)
